# Firestore Migration Testing Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for validating the migration from MongoDB to Firestore. The goal is to ensure data integrity, system functionality, and performance throughout the migration process.

## Testing Categories

### 1. Database Connectivity Testing

**Objective**: Verify basic connectivity and operation with Firestore.

**Tests**:
- [x] Verify Firestore connection with proper credentials
- [x] Test read operations from Firestore collections
- [x] Test write operations to Firestore collections
- [x] Verify proper error handling for connectivity issues
- [x] Test reconnection logic after connection loss

**Command**: `npm run firestore:test`

### 2. Data Migration Testing

**Objective**: Ensure data is correctly migrated from MongoDB to Firestore.

**Tests**:
- [x] Verify document counts match between MongoDB and Firestore
- [x] Test migration of specific collections (customers, waitlist, etc.)
- [x] Verify field mapping and data type conversion
- [x] Test handling of large documents and collections
- [x] Validate data consistency after migration
- [x] Test rollback procedures

**Command**: `npm run migrate:dry-run`

### 3. API Endpoint Testing

**Objective**: Verify API endpoints work correctly with Firestore.

**Tests**:
- [x] Test all CRUD operations through API endpoints
- [x] Verify authentication and authorization with Firestore
- [x] Test error handling and response format
- [x] Validate API performance with Firestore backend
- [ ] Test API behavior during database switchover

**Command**: `npm run test:firestore-api`

### 4. Dual-Write Testing

**Objective**: Ensure data consistency when writing to both MongoDB and Firestore.

**Tests**:
- [x] Verify writes to MongoDB and Firestore are consistent
- [x] Test error handling when one database write fails
- [x] Validate data integrity across both databases
- [x] Measure performance impact of dual-write operations
- [ ] Test fallback behavior when one database is unavailable

**Command**: `npm run migration-control dual-write -c [collection]`

### 5. Performance Testing

**Objective**: Ensure Firestore performance meets requirements.

**Tests**:
- [ ] Measure API response times with Firestore vs. MongoDB
- [ ] Test system under various load conditions
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Validate query optimization and indexing
- [ ] Test caching effectiveness

**Metrics Endpoint**: `/api/monitoring/firestore`

### 6. Security Testing

**Objective**: Ensure Firestore security is properly configured.

**Tests**:
- [x] Validate Firestore security rules
- [x] Test access control and permissions
- [x] Verify data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Test authentication integration with Firestore
- [ ] Validate field-level security

**Command**: `firebase emulators:start`

### 7. Recovery Testing

**Objective**: Verify backup and restore capabilities.

**Tests**:
- [x] Test Firestore backup procedures
- [x] Verify restore operations from backups
- [x] Validate data integrity after restore
- [ ] Test point-in-time recovery options
- [ ] Verify backup rotation and management

**Commands**:
- `npm run backup:firestore`
- `npm run restore:firestore`

## Test Environments

### Development Environment
- Firestore Emulator for local testing
- Test collections with sample data
- Configuration for fast iteration and debugging

### Staging Environment
- Production-like environment with real GCP Firestore
- Copy of production data (anonymized if necessary)
- Same configuration as production

### Production Environment
- Gradual rollout using migration control tools
- Monitoring and metrics collection
- Rollback capability

## Test Data

1. **Sample Test Data**:
   - Create realistic test data for all collections
   - Include edge cases and special characters
   - Simulate various document sizes

2. **Migration Test Data**:
   - Copy of production MongoDB data (anonymized)
   - Large datasets to test migration performance
   - Data with various schemas and complexity

## Test Execution Process

### Pre-Migration Testing
1. Run connectivity and basic operation tests
2. Perform migration dry runs
3. Validate data integrity after migration
4. Test API endpoints with Firestore backend

### During Migration Testing
1. Enable dual-write mode for each collection
2. Monitor metrics and performance
3. Validate data consistency between databases
4. Test gradual switchover from MongoDB to Firestore

### Post-Migration Testing
1. Verify all API endpoints with Firestore-only mode
2. Run performance tests under production load
3. Validate security and access controls
4. Test backup and restore procedures

## Monitoring During Testing

1. **Metrics to Monitor**:
   - API response times
   - Database operation counts and latencies
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage (memory, CPU)
   - Query performance

2. **Alerting Thresholds**:
   - Response time increases >50%
   - Error rate increases >2%
   - Failed operations >1%

## Test Result Documentation

For each test run, document:
1. Test name and category
2. Test date and environment
3. Pass/fail status
4. Performance metrics
5. Failures and error messages
6. Resolution steps for failures

## Final Validation Checklist

Before completing the migration, verify:

- [ ] All API tests pass with Firestore backend
- [ ] Data integrity validation is successful
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds MongoDB baseline
- [ ] Security controls are properly implemented
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures are validated
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are operational

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found:

1. Switch all collections back to MongoDB using migration control
2. Disable GCP features globally
3. Redeploy application with MongoDB configuration
4. Document failure scenarios and root causes
5. Fix issues before attempting migration again
