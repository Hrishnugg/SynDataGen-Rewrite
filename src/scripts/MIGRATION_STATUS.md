# Firestore Migration Status

## Current Status

✅ **Migration Complete!** All collections have been successfully migrated from MongoDB to Firestore and are now in Firestore-only mode.

✅ **MongoDB Cleanup Complete!** All MongoDB-related code, dependencies, and dual-write functionality have been removed from the codebase.

## Database Backend Configuration

| Collection          | Current Mode       |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| customers           | Firestore Only    |
| waitlist            | Firestore Only    |
| projects            | Firestore Only    |
| dataGenerationJobs  | Firestore Only    |

## Technical Implementation Details

- All API endpoints now use Firestore for data storage and retrieval
- Environment variables and backend selection code have been simplified
- MongoDB dependencies have been removed from package.json
- Firestore optimization recommendations have been documented

## Next Steps - Firestore Optimization

After successfully migrating to Firestore and cleaning up MongoDB-related code, our next focus areas are:

1. **Optimize Firestore Queries**
   - Review and optimize indexes for common queries
   - Update query patterns to take advantage of Firestore's capabilities
   - See `src/lib/gcp/firestore/optimize-firestore.md` for detailed guidelines

2. **Enhance Customer and Service Account Management (Phase 2)**
   - Expand customer data model with additional fields
   - Enhance service account creation and management
   - Build admin interface for customer management

3. **Improve Project and Storage Bucket Management (Phase 3)**
   - Enhance project model and API
   - Implement storage bucket management
   - Add monitoring and quota enforcement

## Archiving

Migration-related scripts have been archived but are still available for reference:

- Migration scripts can be found in their original locations
- MongoDB-related code has been fully removed
- Documentation on the migration process is available in `src/scripts/MONGODB_ARCHIVE_README.md`
