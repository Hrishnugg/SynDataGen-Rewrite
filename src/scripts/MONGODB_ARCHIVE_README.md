# MongoDB Scripts Archive

## Migration Complete

The migration from MongoDB to Firestore has been successfully completed. All collections are now using Firestore as the primary database. This directory contains archived scripts that were used during the migration process.

## Archived Scripts

The following scripts were used during the migration and are kept for reference purposes only:

- `test-mongodb.js` - Used to test MongoDB connectivity
- `test-waitlist-dual-write.js` - Used to test dual-write functionality for waitlist submissions
- `validate-data.js` - Used to validate data consistency between MongoDB and Firestore
- `check-backend-status.js` - Used to check the backend status of collections during migration
- `set-backend.js` - Used to set the backend for collections during migration
- `complete-migration.js` - Used to complete the migration for collections
- `migration-control.ts` - Used to control the migration process

## Current Status

- All collections are now using Firestore exclusively
- MongoDB connection code has been removed
- MongoDB dependencies have been removed from package.json
- Dual-write functionality has been disabled

## Database Access

To access the database, use the Firestore service:

```typescript
import { getFirestore } from 'src/lib/services/db-service';

async function getData() {
  const firestore = getFirestore();
  // Use Firestore to access data
  const snapshot = await firestore.collection('collectionName').get();
  // Process data
}
```

## Migration History

1. **Planning Phase** - Assessed MongoDB schema and designed Firestore schema
2. **Development Phase** - Built migration tools and validation scripts
3. **Dual-Write Phase** - Implemented dual-write functionality for all collections
4. **Validation Phase** - Validated data consistency between MongoDB and Firestore
5. **Transition Phase** - Gradually transitioned all collections to Firestore-only mode
6. **Cleanup Phase** - Removed MongoDB code and dependencies

## Next Steps

Now that the migration is complete, focus can shift to:

1. Optimizing Firestore queries and indexes
2. Implementing caching strategies
3. Enhancing customer and service account management (Phase 2)
4. Improving project and storage bucket management (Phase 3)
